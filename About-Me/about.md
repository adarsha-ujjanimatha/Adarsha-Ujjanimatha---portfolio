# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Iâ€™m a recent MSc graduate in Data Science and Analytics from Cardiff University with a passion for solving real-world problems using data.

I have hands-on experience with:
- Machine Learning (NLP, classification models)
- Data Visualization (Tableau, Power BI)
- Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Programming in Python, SQL, and C++

I've built end-to-end projects including an AI-powered YouTube clickbait detector, deep learning for image classification, and a business intelligence dashboard for salary trends. Iâ€™m eager to apply my skills to drive data-driven decisions in dynamic organizations.
