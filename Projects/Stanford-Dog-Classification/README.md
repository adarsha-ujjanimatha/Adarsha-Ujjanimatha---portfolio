# Stanford Dog Breed Classification üê∂

A deep learning project using the Stanford Dogs dataset to classify fine-grained dog breeds using pre-trained CNNs.

**Tech Stack**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, VGG16, ResNet

**Highlights**:
- Built and trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using transfer learning
- Applied data augmentation (flipping, cropping, normalization) to improve model generalization
- Achieved 40.2% validation accuracy on challenging fine-grained classification
- Used VGG16 and ResNet architectures with hyperparameter tuning
