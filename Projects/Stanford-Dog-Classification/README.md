# 🐶 Stanford Dog Classification

This deep learning project focuses on fine-grained image classification using the Stanford Dogs Dataset. The goal was to classify dog breeds using convolutional neural networks.

### 🧠 Models Used:
- VGG16
- ResNet
- Transfer Learning

### 🚀 What I Did:
- Applied data augmentation (cropping, flipping, normalization)
- Used pre-trained models with fine-tuning
- Achieved 40.2% validation accuracy through hyperparameter tuning
